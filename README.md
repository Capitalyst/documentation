## Project Description

- Traditional financial planning applications possess complexities and lack of personalized advice. This involves difficulty in tracking finances, limited access to expert knowledge and inconsistent financial discipline.
- The absence of sufficient educational resources further hampers users' understanding of financial concepts and informed decision-making.
- These tools often lack features that provide consistent reminders and behavioral nudges necessary for maintaining financial goals.
- The lack of engaging and motivational elements can lead to users losing interest and straying from their financial plans.

Our goal is to design and implement a tool that analyzes users' financial data, discerns their goals, and prioritizes them, with stringent security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the users’ financial data.

WiseVault is an Automated financial planning ecosystem that utilizes AI to assist users in efficiently managing their finances. By analyzing spending habits, offering budgeting advice, and giving personalized tips, it helps to optimize financial well-being. Financial planning plays a vital role in helping individuals achieve their financial goals, manage risks, build wealth, and secure a stable financial future. Recognizing that many individuals struggle to manage their finances due to time constraints, our app provides users with accessibility, personalized services, risk management, and educational resources to support them in reaching these objectives. WiseVault provides a comprehensive approach to money management through its user-friendly features such as portfolio management, expense tracking, and future planning. The app includes an AI-driven chatbot, detailed analytics, payment reminders, money-saving suggestions, and personalized recommendations, making financial management simple and fulfilling.
