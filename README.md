## Project Description

Traditional Financial Planning Applications possess complexities and lack of Personalized Advice. This involves difficulty in Tracking Finances, limited Access to Expert Knowledge and Inconsistent Financial Discipline:**

1. **Automated Analysis of Financial Data:**
   - The tool simplifies financial planning by automatically analyzing the user's financial data, removing the complexity of manual calculations and tracking.

2. **Personalized Recommendations:**
   - Using generative AI, the tool identifies users' specific financial goals and priorities, providing customized strategies that fit their unique situations.

3. **Comprehensive Financial Tracking:**
   - Features like budget tracking, goal setting, investment portfolio management, and retirement planning help users monitor all aspects of their finances in one place.

4. **Affordable Expert-Like Advice:**
   - The AI-powered tool offers professional-level financial advice at a fraction of the cost of hiring a personal financial advisor, making expert guidance more accessible.

5. **Enhanced Financial Discipline:**
   - By setting and monitoring financial goals, the tool helps users stay disciplined and make informed decisions, ensuring they remain on track to achieve long-term financial success.
   -
Traditional payment methods have long suffered from issues of limited accessibility and availability, particularly in the context of executing government welfare schemes and conducting large-scale monetary transactions. These problems have given rise to corruption, a lack of transparency, and the misappropriation of allocated funds. While the introduction of online transactions and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has addressed some of these issues, a significant portion of the rural population still lacks access to bank accounts and reliable internet connectivity. As a result, the money allocated for government scheme beneficiaries often goes astray or falls into the wrong hands due to the involvement of multiple intermediaries. Additionally, some beneficiaries struggle to utilize the funds for their intended purposes.

This problem also extends to corporate companies, which face challenges in efficiently managing employee allowances. While the newly launched e-RUPI system holds promise as a potential solution, the absence of a centralized software platform for managing, distributing, and redeeming e-RUPI vouchers hinders widespread adoption of this digital mechanism in India. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a user-friendly digital payment system that not only streamlines payment processes and enhances transparency but also improves accessibility, ensures accountability, facilitates e-voucher management, and offers offline capabilities.

eZ-RUPI is a product suite we have come up with, creating an ecosystem for e-RUPI Digital Wallet transactions. e-RUPI is the digital payment solution developed with the support of DFS (Department of Financial Services) and NHA (National Health Authority) and is powered by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). eZ-RUPI is more than just a standalone application; it is a comprehensive product suite that has been meticulously crafted to establish a thriving ecosystem for e-RUPI digital wallet transactions. Our aim is to revolutionize the way digital payments are made and bring about a seamless and secure experience for users.

## Inspiration for the Project:

It has been estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States each year. This happens for the reason that there are too many pets that are enrolled into shelters and only a few people consider adoption when they look out for a pet.

When our team heard about the animals that were in danger each year, it became a goal for us to help these speechless beings somehow. After brainstorming for a long time we came up with the idea of **PetMe**. We believe in the policy of saving animals and thus saving lives. Every life matters and we wish to be the part of the change that is making the same possible.

## Accomplishments:

We are proud to build a website where pet lovers can easily adopt animals that need a home. They can not only provide medical assistance to them but can also allow their fellow comrades in the community to adopt them.

## What's next for PetMe 📲

In future, we plan to scale this application to reach as many people as possible and facilitate adoption and donation of animals.

Furthermore, we plan to connect with the nearest government organization that provides medical assistance to stray animals.
